1. Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s):
	cameraTransform for SetViewMatrix contained uninitialized values; fix by initializing as identity matrix (could have created constructor for mat4 as well, probably better solution).

2. Memory leak:
	Vector of Object* never deleted; loop through in RT destructor and delete.

3. Misuse of virtual destructor in Object/Sphere - derived class overrides virtual parent destructor.

4. Delete mismatch in Object - call delete[] to remove char array.

5. Memory leak:
	Recursive TracePath function never deletes dynamically allocated Ray objects; remove unnessecary 'new' statement for simple struct.
